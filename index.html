    <h2 style="--t: 1">Intro</h2>
    <h3 style="--t: 2">Hello, I'm fanqasy. I'm a programmer and I know Java, Lua(U), Python and HTML.</h3>
    <h2 style="--t: 3">Skill set</h2>
    <h3 style="--t: 4">
        I have been scripting on Roblox for almost 2 to 3 years now. I can code in almost any style you would prefer me to, for example object-orienting programming,
        <br> module programming, etc. I can code most things you would like me to and I can work in either a team or solo.
        <br> I know both back-end scripting and front-end scripting making me pretty versatile.
        <br><br> Here are some key things I specialize in:
        <ul>
            <li>All types of DataStores and Inventories.</li>
            <li>Shops/NPCs.</li>
            <li>AI (Normal/Custom).</li>
            <li>UIs.</li>
            <li>Back-Ended scripts.</li>
            <li>Front-Ended scripts.</li>
            <li>Custom Frameworks.</li>
            <li>Zones.</li>
            <li>FPS/Weapons/Guns.</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        I can make you full games, no matter the genre, but you'd have to
        <br> pay the necessary amount and explain it well enough for me to
        <br> understand what you'd want.

        <br> half of the payment upfront, but I will only give you the work 
        <br> after I recieve the payment, so please don't waste my time.
